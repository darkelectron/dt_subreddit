__Big Changes__

- The _lighttable_ view has been rewritten and the film strip reworked.
    Different overlay(many types) information can be selected depending on the thumb on the lighttable.
- A complete overhaul of the CSS.
- The new negadoctor module has been added to help inverting negative films.
- A new histogram display called RGB Parade has been added. At the same time the histogram module height can now be adjusted with `Ctrl+Scroll`.
- Clarify the three possible workflows. The new preference introduces three workflows:
    + display-referred : use base-curve module
    + scene-referred : use filmic and exposure modules (new default)
    + none : use neither base-curve nor filmic
- Filmic RGB is updated to v4 (new color science) with integrated highlight recovery.
